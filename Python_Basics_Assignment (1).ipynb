        "      => Readability: One of the standout features of Python is its clear and straightforward. This makes it incredibly beginner - friendly, allowing new programmers to pick it up quickly.  \n",
        "      => Simplicity: The way Python uses to define code blocks not only enhances readability but also promotes good coding practices, making it easier to maintain and collaborate.\n",
        "      => Versatile: Python is a versatile language that supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
        "     => Cross Platform: Python runs on various operating systems, including Windows, mac OS, and Linux, making it versatile.\n",
        "     =>Community Support: Python has a large and active community, which means plenty of resources, tutorials, and third-party modules are available.      \n",
        "     =>Dynamically in nature: No need to declare the type of a variable when you create one. The type is determined at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Describe the role of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a program.\n",
        "     => In Python, predefined words, also known as keywords, serve as the fundamental building blocks of the language. These keywords have specific meanings and purposes, and they cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names, function names, etc.). Keywords help define the structure and control flow of a program. One of the key roles of these predefined words is to control the flow of execution in a program.\n",
        "\n",
        ". Role of Predefined Keywords\n",
        "   a. Control Flow: Keywords like if, else, elif, for and while are used to control the flow of execution in a program, allowing for conditional execution and looping.\n",
        "   b. Keywords such as def. and class are used to define functions and classes, respectively, which are fundamental building blocks in Python programming.\n",
        " \t c.Data management: Keywords like import and from are used to include external modules and libraries, enabling code reuse and modular programming.\n",
        "\t d.Exception Handling: Keywords like try, except, finally, and raise are used to handle exceptions and errors gracefully.\n",
        "\t e.Context Management: The with keyword is used for resource management, ensuring that resources are properly acquired and release\n",
        "\n",
        "  For example, consider the following Python program that uses several predefined words:\n",
        " def check_even_odd(number):\n",
        "  if number % 2 == 0:\n",
        "  return \"Even\"\n",

        " print (f\"{i} is {check_even_odd(i)}\")\n",
        "\n",
        " In this program:\n",
        " - The def keyword is used to define the function check_even_odd.\n",
        " - The if and else keywords are used to create a conditional statement that checks whether the number is even or odd.\n",
        "- The for keyword is used to iterate through numbers from 1 to 10 using a loop.\n",

        "In Python, objects can be classified as mutable or immutable based on whether their state can be modified after they are created.\n",
        "*Mutable Objects: - Mutable objects are those whose state or value can be changed after they are created. This means you can modify the contents of the object without changing its identity. - Examples of mutable objects in Python include lists, dictionaries, and sets.\n",
        " Immutable Objects: - Immutable objects, on the other hand, cannot be changed after they are created. Any modification to an immutable object results in the creation of a new object rather than altering the original one. - Examples of immutable objects in Python include strings, tuples, and frozensets.\n",
        " Comparison\n",
        "1. Modification: - Mutable: The contents can be changed. For example, you can add, remove, or update elements in a list.\n",
        "- Immutable: The contents cannot be changed. Any attempt to modify an object results in a new object.\n",
        "2. Identity: - Mutable: The identity of the object remains the same even after modifications.\n",
        "- Immutable: The identity of the object changes when a new object is created due to modifications.\n",
        " 3. **Performance: - Mutable: Generally, more efficient for operations involving frequent modifications since they do not require creating new objects.\n",
        " - Immutable: May be less efficient for extensive modifications because new objects need to be created.\n",
        "\n",
        " Examples\n",
        " Creating a mutable list my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "   print(\"Original List:\", my_list)\n",
        " Modifying the list my_list.append(4)\n",
        "    print(\"Modified List:\", my_list)  \n",

        "\n",
        "3. Logical Operators\n",
        "Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.\n",

        "  Type casting in Python refers to the conversion of a variable from one data type to another. This process is essential when you want to perform operations that require different data types to be compatible with each other. Python provides several built-in functions for type casting, including int(), float(), str(), and list().\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example of Type Casting Consider the following example where we need to convert a string that represents a number into an integer so that we can perform arithmetic operations:\n",
        "   String representation of a number\n",
        "           num_str = \"10\"\n",

        "   print(\"Result of the addition:\", result) # Output: Result of the addition : 15\n",
        "\n",
        "   In this example, the string num_str is converted into an integer using the int() function. After the conversion, we can successfully add 5 to it, yielding a result of 15.\n",
        "   Another common scenario involves converting an integer to a string for concatenation.\n",

        "\n",
        "  =>Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. The primary conditional statements in Python are if, elif, and else. Here's how they work:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Basic Structure\n",
        "  1.if statement: This checks a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true.\n",

        " 2.elif statement: This stands for \"else if\" and allows you to check multiple conditions. It is executed if the previous if or elif conditions are false.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3.else statement: This is executed if none of the preceding conditions are true.\n",
        "\n",
        "How Conditional Statements Work\n",
        " 1.Evaluation of Conditions: When the program reaches a conditional statement, it evaluates the condition(s) in the order they are written.\n",
        "2.Execution of Code Blocks:\n",
        "  \tIf the condition in the if statement is true, the corresponding block of code is executed, and the rest of the conditions are skipped.\n",
        " \tIf the if condition is false, the program checks the next elif condition (if any). If that condition is true, its block of code is executed.\n",
        "  If none of the if or elif conditions are true, the else block (if present) is executed.\n",
        "\n",

        "  else:\n",
        "     print(\"It's not a good day for a picnic.\")\n",

        "1.\t For Loops A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string). This loop is particularly useful when the number of iterations is known beforehand or when you need to iterate over items in a collection.\n",

        "       for fruit in fruits:\n",
        "           print(fruit)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. While Loops A while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. This type of loop is useful when the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a condition being met.\n",
        " Example:\n",
        "  count = 0\n",
        "while count < 5:\n",
        " print(count)\n",
        "count += 1\n",
        "\n",
        "4.\tNested Loops A nested loop is a loop inside another loop. This is useful for scenarios where you need to perform operations on multi-dimensional data structures, such as lists of lists or matrices. *Example:\n",
        " for i in range(3): # Outer loop\n",
        " for j in range(2): # Inner loop\n",
